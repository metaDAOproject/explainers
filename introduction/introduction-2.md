Explain how humans have solved the coordination problem before.

Include the following pieces:

Refreshing the reader on the coordination problem: that people don't naturally do what they're supposed to do (maximize benefits to group)
Plato's solution is to centralize control in a small group of 'philosopher kings' (i.e., wise altruists) who care about betterment of the whole. Examples of this are centrally-planned economies (e.g., historical Soviet Union, present-day China to some extent) and theocracies (e.g., Islamic Caliphates, Europe during Middle Ages to a large extent).
Another solution, very common in economic institutions, is to align incentives. As before, you centralize control in a small group and allow them to exert outsized control on the institution, but instead of hoping for altruism you give the group a taste of the group's upside or downside. Founder-led companies & public companies with management stock incentives examples of this. Democracies are also an example of this.
Both are flawed, probably the former more than the latter.
Reason to be skeptical about any human altruists.
Incentive / information ratio is too low. Who votes in stockholder meetings? Who extensively researches political candidates, incl. voting records? Very easy for the people to 'talk the talk w/o walking the walk'
Culture & religion are a third solution for decentralized control & incentive alignment. Fragile because they are based on false premises.

# From Corporations to Nations: How the Meta-DAO is Going to Change Everything (Part 2)

At this point, hopefully you understand the human coordination problem discussed in [part 1](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-1-a8657562b12e). For a quick refresher, you can think of the problem as follows:
- Human groups fare best when their members take actions that benefit the group as a whole. For example, a company fares best when its employees are focused on growing it.
- Instead of deciding what actions to take based on what will bring about the greatest good to the group, humans tend to be either greedy, taking actions that benefit themselves at the expense of the group, or conformist, taking whatever action will gain them acceptance in their peer group. For example, many people would prefer 'looting' a company (taking a salary without doing any work) to taking actions that grow the company.
- Wat do?

This problem has been a thorn in the side of mankind for millenia, and many have tried to remove it. Among them include intellectuals such as Plato^1 and Thomas Hobbes^2, statesmen such as the framers of the United States constitution^3, and technology founders such as Jeff Bezos^4 and Reed Hastings^5. Although all have thought about the problem differently, they were all trying to figure out how humans could work better together.

Of course, we believe that the Meta-DAO will blast them all out of the water as an engine of human coordination. But just in case you are not convinced by our proclamation of superiority, we ought to review some of these historical approaches and their limitations. We can group these approaches into three categories, namely **culture and religion**, **philosopher-kingdoms**, and **aligning incentives**. 

## Culture and religion

> "Whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them" (Matthew 7:12)

> “Help one another in acts of piety and righteousness. And do not assist each other in acts of sinfulness and transgression. And be aware of Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in punishment” (Quran 5:2).

> "Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country" John F. Kennedy, former U.S. President

> "If you truly loved yourself, you could never hurt another." Buddha

> "Being ethical turns out to be a selfish imperative. You want to be ethical because it attracts the other long-term players in the network... so being ethical pays off in the long run." Naval Ravikant, high priest in Silicon Valley

Imagine a city where all residents believe the above statements. Now imagine an alternate city where all residents believe "my only imperative is maximizing my own interest, which usually means screwing other people over." How would these two cities differ? 

Some challenges the second city might face include:
1. [NIMBYism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY), or the non-optimal restricting of housing supply to keep home prices high for existing homeowners.
2. Exploiting of public resources, including people littering on sidewalks, stealing electricity, dumping waste, etc.
3. Politicians who are laser-focused on the next election cycle instead of improving residents' lives

The first city might face these challenges too, but would probably face them to a smaller degree. Its residents would be more oriented towards the group as a whole and would be more willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the group. 

This is the core of culture and religion: exploit the fact that people generally conform to the ideas around them and spread ideas that make them take actions for the benefit of the greater good. These ideas don't even need to be true, they just need to be beneficial for the group. Examples of this are the golden rule and "be good to people and you'll spend eternity in paradise, be bad to people and you'll spend eternity in a fiery pit."

![golden rule across religions](media/golden-rule-in-religions.jpeg)

Cultures and relions have some problems though, some of which the reader has most likely encountered. These include:
- When a group depends on its members following a pre-set list of rules in a sheeplike manner, that group tends to adapt poorly to new environments that make their old rules invalid. See, for example, Islamic Law's impact on the stagnation of the Middle East.^6
- Wolfs who really self-maximize at the expense of others can mask as sheep who follow the culture's ethics by simply "[saying] all the right shibboleths," in the words of likely wolf Sam Bankman-Fried.^7
- Because cultures only exist in the minds of humans, and because humans are fickle, good cultures can be replaced by bad cultures. Hence the meme "hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times."
- Even if a culture emphasizes the greater good, the masses that follow that culture may now understand *how* to bring the greater good about.

## Philosopher-kingdoms

> "The people have no understanding and only repeat what their rulers tell them." Plato, *The Republic Book VI*

Plato doubted that the masses were capable of achieving the greater good, considering them generally unintelligent. Accordingly, he advoted **centralizing control in a small group of wise and altruistic leaders (philosopher-kings).** These philosopher-kings would prioritize the global consequences of their decisions, with no self-interest involved.

![philosopher king 2x2](media/altruistic-decision-maker.excalidraw.png)

Plato's logic runs as follows:
- Because the philosopher-kings would be both wise and altruistic, we could trust them to both discern effects of their actions and to pick actions that would maximize benefits to the group. 
- Thus, instead of leaving the group's actions up to the stupid and/or greedy masses, the philosopher-kings should make all of the group's decisions. For example, these kings would dictate what work individual members of the society would perform (e.g., farming, building, carpentry).

Although Plato's vision has never been fully implemented, many organizations have gotten close. Examples include the Catholic Church during Medieval Europe^8 and present-day Singapore and China.^9

Since an organization being governed by an extremely wise (able to discern global benefits and costs) and altruistic (focused only on global rather than local impacts) leader would indeed solve the human coordination problem, most criticisms are that such people do not exist. Examples of quotes along these lines include:

> "The problem with philosopher-kings is that they are still human beings, and human beings are fallible. Putting too much power in the hands of a single person, even if that person is a philosopher, is a recipe for disaster." Bertrand Russell

> "It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong." Thomas Sowell

A good example of a failed philosopher-kingdom is China under Chairman Mao. Because he was so popular, he was basically unaccountable, which allowed him to implement policies that led to mass-starvation without being ejected from office.^10

## Aligning incentives

A third approach, and the most common one in the modern world, is aligning incentives. The idea is as follows:
- As in a philosopher-kingdom, centralize power in a group of administrators.
- Unlike a philosopher-kingdom, have these administrators, or at least the top ones, accountable to the broader group.

For example, shareholders of a public company vote in boards of directors and in effect CEOs. Citizens of a democracy vote on presidents and/or legislative representatives.

![administrative-stakeholder-relationship](media/StakeholderAdministratorRelationship.excalidraw.png)

Because administrators are voted in, they are accountable to further the interests of the group. For example, in a public company, the shareholders elect the board of directors and management teams. If the management team does not act in the interest of the shareholders, they risk being voted out in the next shareholder meeting. In a democracy, citizens vote for their representatives, who are then responsible for representing their interests in the legislative process. Additionally, management teams often receive financial incentives via stock ownership or options, which aligns their interests with the shareholders.

The goal of all of this is to internalize the [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) of the decision-makers' actions, which means that the decision-makers take into account the effects of their actions on the entire group, not just their own interests. By internalizing these externalities, even a decision-maker motivated solely by personal gain would take actions that further the group's interests, because those actions would also benefit themselves.

![externality-internalization](media/externality-internalization.excalidraw.png)

Unfortunately, practice often falls short of theory. Despite the intentions behind aligning incentives, there are numerous obstacles to achieving sufficient alignment between decision-makers and the group they are meant to represent. For example, voters in many voting-based systems have little incentive to thoroughly research their appointees, which means that those in power may have little incentive to act in the best interest of the group.^11 Grifters, such as Ginni Rometty who as CEO of IBM presided over 24 quarters of declining revenues, can remain in power as long as they can 'work the system.'^12

![Ginni Rometty, Grifter-in-Chief](media/ginni-rometti.jpg)

Start-ups are one area where the CEO is usually sufficiently aligned with the company as a whole, but founders eventually retire or die, and when they do they will be likely be replaced by a grifter.

## Conclusion

While all of these approaches are better than humans living with no organization at all (i.e., lawless chaos), they each have serious flaws. In the next post, we will cover the Meta-DAO's approach and how it might be better.

Between then and now, you might want to consider the following question: are you comfortable with the current state of affairs? Or have you grown tired of the institutions that manage the world's people and capital?
